# your notes - for Glasgow University students
Kind of a social media. We have users, that have an account, and they will share their notes through photos in their profiles. Each notes will be categorized by "year" and "course", and can be shared with anyone or only your friends. Additionally, you will be able to set "I'm studying" mode, which can be seen by your friends, and they can ask whether you want to study together (videocall, 2 minutes).

Additional idea: Ask a question, and a web scrapper will try to answer it, or at least pass you the link to the resources.
